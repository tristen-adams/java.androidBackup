# java.androidBackup
 Simple Backup program made for use in backing up Android devices, but it can be used on anything.

Requires Java Runtime Environment

====================
Instructions
====================
1) Choose source directory
2) Choose target directory. By default, it will create a new folder with today's date in the selected directory.
3) Click "Create Backup" and it will start working. It may take a while, depending on how fast your devices are and how many files you want to transfer.

====================
Notes
====================
This isn't a great program. There are many improvements to be made with the UI, including an active progress bar as well as maybe a dialogue box to let you know that the backup is complete. Maybe at the end I could verify the files between the two locations when the copying is finished, but I'd probably want a way to disable that.
